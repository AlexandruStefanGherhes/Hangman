## My process

### Built with

- React
- Typescript
- Tailwind
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

During this small project i worked for the first time with Typescript which game me a headache until i got the hang of it, also the second time using tailwind which is more easy to use now.
Beside these technologies it was interesting coming up with the logic the for the game itself.
